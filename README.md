# GPUFuzzyART

For this setup to work you need a tapped Onnx Model and the onnxruntime-linux-x64-gpu-1.23.2 folder downloaded (see [ONNX Runtime v1.23.2](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases/tag/v1.23.2)).

You will likely need to edit the Makefile to fix linker errors if your file paths do not match what it expects.
